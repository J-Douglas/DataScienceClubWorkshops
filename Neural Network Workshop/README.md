# WDSC â€” Neural Network and Computer Vision Workshop

## Summary

As the VP of Education, this was the workshop I presented for the Waterloo Data Science Club (WDSC). In the workshop, I go over the math and theory behind how neural networks work. In a notebook demo, I show two applications of neural networks: building a feedforward neural network from scratch and classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset (computer vision). At the end of the workshop, I go over the 4 different types of layers used to create convolutional neural networks (CNN's), which are the most commonly used neural network architecture for computer vision.

## Presentation

For the workshop, I create a slideshow that went over terms and concepts used in neural networks. You can look at the slideshow [here](https://bit.ly/2U0U8Jr).

## Notebook

I created a notebook to demonstrate two applications of neural networks: a feedforward neural network made from scratch and an ANN made with TensorFlow for classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset (computer vision). You can see the notebook [here](https://bit.ly/32pKlRJ) or click on the notebook file in this repository.

## YouTube

The workshop was recorded and uploaded to YouTube! You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_YsKhBooOc&ab_channel=UWaterlooDataScience).
