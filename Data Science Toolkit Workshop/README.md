# Data Science Libraries and Tools Workshop

## Summary

This was the workshop I presented at the Dataverse Conference for the Waterloo Data Science Club (WDSC) in Fall 2021. In the workshop, I first go over the features of a Google Colab notebook and show how to navigate/use popular dataset website such as Kaggle, PapersWithCode, and Google Dataset Search. For the remaineder of the workshop, I demonstrated the basic functionality of 6 Python libraries frequently used in data science: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## Notebook

I created a Google Colab notebook to demonstrate the notebooks functionality. As well, I wrote several code cells to show the functionality of several important data science library. You can see the notebook [here](https://bit.ly/3ct2ZN4) or click on the notebook file in this repository.
