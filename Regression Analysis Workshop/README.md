# Regression Analysis Workshop

## Summary

This was the workshop I presented for the Waterloo Data Science Club (WDSC) in Fall 2021. This workshop goes over the theory and application of regression analysis. The workshop begins with background information about the motivation for machine learning and the different types of machine learning. We introduce the importance of regression, and how it is achieved using a cost function and optimizer. As well, three types of regression are discussed in more detail: linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression. For the second half of the workshop, we will go over  how to implement each type of regression and apply them to different datasets in a notebook.

## Presentation

For the workshop, I created slides that went over the types of machine learning, what regression is and how it works, and three types of regression models. You can look at the slideshow [here](https://bit.ly/3F8oC2r).

## Notebook

I created a notebook to demonstrate the implementation of linear regression, poisson regression, and logistic regression. The notebook can be found [here](https://bit.ly/39kUSRm) and the datasets used can be found [here](https://github.com/J-Douglas/DataScienceClubWorkshops/tree/main/Regression%20Analysis%20Workshop/datasets).

## YouTube

The workshop was recorded and uploaded to YouTube! You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeU2nlwUleQ).
