# Regression Analysis Workshop

## Summary

This was the workshop I presented for the Waterloo Data Science Club (WDSC) in Fall 2021. This workshop goes over the theory and application of regression analysis. The workshop goes over the basic of machine learning and an introduction to the concepts used in regression. As well, three types of regression are discussed in more detail: linear regression, poisson regression, and logistic regression. For the second half of the workshop, we will go over a notebooks which shows how to implement each type of regression and apply them to three different datasets.

## Presentation

For the workshop, I created slides that went over the types of machine learning, what regression is and how it works, and three types of regression models. 

## Notebook

I created a notebook to demonstrate the implementation of linear regression, poisson regression, and logistic regression. The datasets used in the notebook were found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/datasets-for-regression-analysis).

The workshop will be recorded and uploaded to the UWaterloo Data Science Club YouTube channel.
