# WDSC â€” Clustering Workshop

## Summary

As the VP of Education, this was the workshop I presented for the Waterloo Data Science Club (WDSC). In the workshop, I go over what clustering is and its applications in data science. I go over 4 types of clustering algorithms: centroid-based, connectivity-based, density-based, and distribution-based. I explained the k-means algorithm and the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm in detail. At the end of the workshop, I go over a notebook demo to show how to apply the clustering concepts I teach on a real dataset.

## Presentation

For the workshop, I create a slideshow that went over clustering concepts and several techniques. You can look at the slideshow [here](https://bit.ly/3rtUuY3).

## Notebook

I created a notebook to demonstrate the use of k-means clustering with the scikit-learn library. The objective of the demo was to use clustering to classify between the three different species of flowers in the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) given data on the petal width and length. You can see the notebook [here](https://bit.ly/3bIaWP3) or click on the notebook file in this repository.

## YouTube

The workshop was recorded and uploaded to YouTube! You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=127zPeHsFpU&ab_channel=UWaterlooDataScience).
